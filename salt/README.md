## Description
This repository contains the dataset from our paper [**SALT: Sales Autocompletion Linked Business Tables Dataset**](https://openreview.net/forum?id=UZbELpkWIr#discussion) presented at [NeurIPS'24 Table Representation Workshop](https://table-representation-learning.github.io/).

### Abstract
Foundation models, particularly those that incorporate Transformer architectures, have demonstrated exceptional performance in domains such as natural language processing and image processing. Adapting these models to structured data, like tables, however, introduces significant challenges. These difficulties are even more pronounced when addressing multi-table data linked via foreign key, which is prevalent in the enterprise realm and crucial for empowering business use cases. Despite its substantial impact, research focusing on such linked business tables within enterprise settings remains a significantly important yet underexplored domain.
To address this, we introduce a curated dataset sourced from an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system, featuring extensive linked tables. This dataset is specifically designed to support research endeavors in table representation learning. By providing access to authentic enterprise data, our goal is to potentially enhance the effectiveness and applicability of models for real-world business contexts.

### Dataset on Hugging Face

The dataset is now also available via the Hugging Face dataset platform. Check-out: [SALT](https://huggingface.co/datasets/sap-ai-research/SALT)

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

ds = load_dataset("sap-ai-research/SALT")
```

### Usage

#### Example of loading the tables with Hugging Face datasets
Unless pandas library is already installed, install it with:

```bash
pip install pandas
```

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

dataset_name = "sap-ai-research/SALT"
split = "train"  # use "train" or "test"
salesdocuments = load_dataset(dataset_name, "salesdocuments", split=split)
salesdocument_items = load_dataset(dataset_name, "salesdocument_items", split=split)
customers = load_dataset(dataset_name, "customers", split=split)
addresses = load_dataset(dataset_name, "addresses", split=split)

# you can also load the joined table which combines the four tables in one
joined_table = load_dataset(dataset_name, "joined_table", split=split)
```
